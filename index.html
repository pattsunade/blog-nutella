    <p> <strong>Nutella</strong> a brand of sweetened hazelnut cocoa spread. Nutella is manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero and was first introduced in 1964, although its first iteration dates to 1963. Pietro Ferrero owned a bakery in Alba, an Italian town known for the production of hazelnuts. In 1946, he sold the initial 300 kilograms (660 lb) batch of Pasta Gianduja, derived from Gianduja. Originally sold as a solid block,
         Ferrero started to sell a creamy version in <em>1951</em> as Supercrema gianduja.</p>
